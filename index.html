    <h2>Goal during this project</h2>
    <p>My goal for this project is to make a presentation of dishes I like the most, and share the recipes how to make them. At the end of the recipes, I will add some personal impressions I have with these foods, and why I would recommend it to other people.</p>

    <h2>Here are my favorite foods of all time</h2>
    <p>There is no particular order. In these recipe, I'm going to share my personal history about the dish, and a global history about the dish. I'm also going to share some recipe that I personally never used.</p>
