        <p>I eat this Japanese curry for the first time in Japan, when I worked there. It was a great, but not unexcepted discovery. Because I always felt that I would love it. </p>

        <h2>A bit of history</h2>
        <!-- took too much from wikipedia, rephrase and take other sources.-->
        <p>Commonly called カレー in japanese, it is one of the most popular dishes in Japan. The family where I worked for told me that they used to eat at least one per week.</p>
        <p>As wikipedia says, Curry originates in Indian cuisine and was introduced to Japan by the British, during the Meiji era (1868–1912). It was then reinvented to suit Japanese tastes and ingredients. The dish has changed and been adapted so much since its introduction that it stands on its own as uniquely Japanese. The dish became popular and available for purchase at supermarkets and restaurants in the late 1960s. It is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish. Since its first apparition, japanese curry has undergone a wide variety. My favorite would be the Katsu curry (カツカレー).</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>I will be honest, I never cooked a real Japanese curry. The one I ate was in restaurants or ready-made meals. The recipe I'm going to share is from the internet with approximative proportion, depending of your own preferences.</p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>What you need :</legend>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 onions</li>
            <li>150g Carrots</li>
            <li>2-3 Potatoes</li>
            <li>300g Beef or pork or chicken</li>
            <li>200g Rice</li>
            <li>1/2 Golden curry</li>
        </ul>
        </fieldset>
        <p>And that's pretty all.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Here the steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the onion thinly.</li>
            <li>Cut the carrots, the potatoes and the meat of your choice into cubes.</li>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, add a little oil, half the butter, and the onions. Stir regularly. After 10 minutes, add the meat and carrots.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, mix and add the potatoes. Cook for 20-30 minutes. Then check if the meat is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually add your curry cubes.</li>
            <li>Add a little water if it's too thick, or cook a little longer if it's too thin.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all, enjoy your curry now !</p>
